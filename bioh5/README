    Bioh5 

1. Overview 

Bioh5 is a package for reading and writing protein sequence and structure information
in a fast and easy way. It uses Hdf5 format to store data, which is compatible with
many programming languages and environments like Matlab and R.

2. Features

2.1 Hdf5 support: read and write protein features by one line in Matlab.
2.2 Hassle-free compression: your data are stored compressed.

3. Install

3.1 Compilation
Please make sure you have cmake package (version later than 2.4) installed on your system.

$ mkdir build ; cd build ; cmake ..
$ make 
$ make install
$ make doc

3.2 To install to a user-defined folder, replace "cmake ." by

cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=[your library folder] .

3.3 Specify the directory of HDF5 library 

You can change the variable of CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH in the CMakeLists.txt with your 
packages path.

set(CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH [your path to home of HDF5 library]
      		[your path to home of other library]
		)

4. Dependency

To build a Bioh5 file for a given sequence, you are required to install Sheng's gen_feature program.
