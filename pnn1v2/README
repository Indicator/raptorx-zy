    Parallel Neuronal Network 0.1.0

1. Introduction:

This PNN package is a custom parallel artificial neuronal network for training and prediction the pairwise statistical energy of protein sequences.
2. Features:

2.1 Support multiple neuronal network layers
2.2 Reading and writing features in HDF5 files
2.3 Parallelization using MPI

3. Installation

3.1 Compilation
Please make sure you have cmake package (version later than 2.4) installed on your system.

$ mkdir build ; cd build ; cmake ..
$ make 
$ make install
$ make doc

3.2 To install to a user-defined folder, replace "cmake ." by

cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=[your library folder] .

3.3 Specify the directory of HDF5 library 

You can change the variable of CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH in the CMakeLists.txt with your 
packages path.

set(CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH [your path to home of HDF5 library]
      		[your path to home of other library]
		)

4. Running the program

4.1 Training 

Run Nnprtrain to see the usage and the definition of parameters.

$ Nnpftrain -h [A file containing a list of hdf5 files, e.g. h5list.h10 ]
            -m [The prefix of generated models, e.g. model/model-100-40-r0.1-withss-pre-cb-h100]
            -s [Number of output lables, e.g. 13] 
            -r [The regularization factor, e.g. 0.1]
            -nn [The number of neuronal nodes in each layer, e.g. 100,40,30,20 stands for 100 nodes on the 
		layer connected to the input features, and 40,30,20 are number of nodes for hidden layers]
            -dn [The dimension of features, e.g. 1580]
            -maxiter [The maximal iterations in the optimization, e.g. 3000]

In the file of hdf5 files list, each line can have several hdf5 files for input, and all these
files will be used in one process. Thus, you can distribute different number of samples to 
each MPI process in order to balance the loading of each process. 

4.2 Run Nnprpredict to see the usage.
