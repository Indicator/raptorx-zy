	/** The following code is taken (and adapted to BALL's C++ interface)
		from the code provided at
		
		 	http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/~pbourke/other/random/

		The following comment stems from the original C source code:

		This Random Number Generator is based on the algorithm in a FORTRAN
		version published by George Marsaglia and Arif Zaman, Florida State
		University; ref.: see original comments below. 
		At the fhw (Fachhochschule Wiesbaden, W.Germany), Dept. of Computer
		Science, we have written sources in further languages (C, Modula-2
		Turbo-Pascal(3.0, 5.0), Basic and Ada) to get exactly the same test
		results compared with the original FORTRAN version. 
		pril 1989
		Karl-L. Noell <NOELL@DWIFH1.BITNET>
    		and  Helmut  Weber <WEBER@DWIFH1.BITNET>

		This random number generator originally appeared in "Toward a Universal
		Random Number Generator" by George Marsaglia and Arif Zaman.
		Florida State University Report: FSU-SCRI-87-50 (1987)
		It was later modified by F. James and published in "A Review of Pseudo-
		random Number Generators"
		THIS IS THE BEST KNOWN RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR AVAILABLE.
		(However, a newly discovered technique can yield
		a period of 10^600. But that is still in the development stage.)
		It passes ALL of the tests for random number generators and has a period
		of 2^144, is completely portable (gives bit identical results on all
		machines with at least 24-bit mantissas in the floating point
		representation).
		The algorithm is a combination of a Fibonacci sequence (with lags of 97
		and 33, and operation "subtraction plus one, modulo one") and an
		"arithmetic sequence" (using subtraction).
		
		Use IJ = 1802 & KL = 9373 to test the random number generator. The
		subroutine RANMAR should be used to generate 20000 random numbers.
		Then display the next six random numbers generated multiplied by *4096
		If the random number generator is working properly, the random numbers
		should be:
			6533892.0  14220222.0  7275067.0
			6172232.0  8354498.0   10633180.0
