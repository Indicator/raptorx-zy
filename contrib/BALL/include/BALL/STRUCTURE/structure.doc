	/**	\defgroup	StructureGeometric Geometric property processors.
			The applicators, processors, and collectors described in 
			this chapter are used to extract geometric properties out
			of a given molecular object or to extract parts of these
			objects according to their geometric properties. \par
			Using the  \link BoundingBoxProcessor BoundingBoxProcessor \endlink , the bounding box 
			of a given molecular object can be calculated. The bounding box is
			represented by the lowest and highest coordinates occuring in the 
			molecular object, i.e. the bounding box is the smallest rectangular
			box (with sides parallel to the coordinate axes) that encloses all
			atoms in the molecular object. \par
			The  \link GeometricCenterProcessor GeometricCenterProcessor \endlink  calculates the geometric 
			center of all atoms contained in the molecular object it is applied to. \par
			With the aid of the  \link FragmentDistanceCollector FragmentDistanceCollector \endlink  it is possible
			to collect all molecular fragments that are within a given distance
			from a certain fragment. This is useful to extract the relevant molecular
			environment (e.g. to examin a binding site). \par
