	/**	Atom bijection.
			This class implements a mapping of two sets of atoms onto each other.
			It is used by the \link StructureMapper StructurMapper \endlink class
			and the \link RMSDMinimizer RMSDMinimizer \endlink classes to define
			which atoms are mapped onto each other.
			\p
			There are a few methods for general mappings (based on atom order, atom names, etc.)
			that should suffice for most applications. If you want to match proteins based on
			particular mappings (e.g. based on a pairwise alignment), you should create the mapping
			yourself. This is easily done by pushing an AtomPair into the vector:
			\code
				Atom* atom1 = ...;
				Atom* atom2 = ...;
	
				// Create an empty bijection
				AtomBijection bijection;

				// Map atom1 onto atom2.
				bijection.push_back(AtomBijection::AtomPair(atom1, atom2));
			\endcode
			\p
			The class behaves more or less like the vector of atom pointer pairs it
			truly is. In particular, the STL container interface has been fully 
			implemented.
