This directory contains all necessary means to create
a Debian package from a BALL CVS tree. It was created
by Andreas Moll from the BALL project team (upstream
author) and can be freely used by any downstream author
to do the packaging. The directory is named
debian-upstream to prevent any potential problems
between up- and downstream authors.

There are three different scripts in this folder:

createDebianSource:
Intended to create a Debin source package from CVS.
It does a CVS checkout, and creates a tarball that
is then moved to /var/tmp/$USER and extracted there.
To prevent unnecessary overhead for other platforms,
it also removes the Windows and MacOS folders and
afterwards creates a new tarball.
Finally the package building process is started and
the following two scripts are started.

debian-ball-install:
Build script, that may be reused for other platforms.

createBALLVIEWDEB:
It copies all relevant files like binaries, 
documentation, data files and so on into the folder
debian/ballview for the packaging later on.

If you have any questions on this approach, feel
