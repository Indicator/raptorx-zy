<blockquote>
An MD simulation is very computational intense: 30 steps 
for a molecule like the currently loaded take around 20 seconds,
depending on the computational power.
<br><br>
When the simulation is over we will leave the field of molecular mechanics
and come to an other field:
To understand a protein's function, it is often also necessary to study
its electrostatic field. This can be easily done using BALLView, where
you can compute the electrostatic potentials in space in an FDPB
setting with just a few mouse clicks.<br><br>
When you press Next, such an FDPB electrostatic computation will
be performed. Depending on the performance of your machine
this might take a moment.
