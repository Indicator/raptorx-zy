<blockquote>
This completes our interactive tour of BALLView.<br><br>
But apart from what was shown in this demo, there are numerous
additional features to explore, like e.g. the integrated peptide
builder, the POVRay export, or the powerful Python scripting
support.
Additional information and these features can be found in BALLView's manual,
that is available in the program itself and 
at <a href="http://www.ballview.org" target="_blank">http://www.ballview.org</a>
<br><br>
You can proceed to the BALLView tutorial by pressing the <b>Next</b> button.
