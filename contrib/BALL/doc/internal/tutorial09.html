<h3> Creating a isocontour surface </h3>

<blockquote>
An other way to visualise the electrostatics grid are isocontour surfaces which 
connect all neighbouring points in the grid which have the same electrostatic 
value. We will now create such a isocontour surface:
First find the </b>"Datasets"</b> widget, then highlight the FDPB dataset and use its 
context menu or the menu entry "<b>Tools->Grids->Render Contour Surface</b>" to
create the surface.
In the now open dialog enter the value <b>0.01</b> as threshold and press "<b>Ok</b>".
It also possible to create multiple iso surface with different colors.
