<h3>Rotating the camera</h3>

<blockquote>
After we created the peptide we can freely position the camera:
To do so click with a mouse button into the 3D graphics view and drag the mouse:
<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li> Left button: Rotate
<li> Middle or Wheel: Zoom
<li> Right button: Move view 
</ul>
<br>
When you are finished playing around with the camera,
center the camera on the peptide:
Find the widget with the name <b>Structures</b> and
highlight the System by <b>clicking on its name ("ARND")</b>
Then press the right mouse button to open a context menu and press on the
<b>Focus</b> entry.
This will take you to the next step of the demo.
