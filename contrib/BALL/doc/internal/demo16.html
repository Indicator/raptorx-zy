<blockquote>
An other way to visualize the electrostatics grid are isocontour surfaces.
These surface connect all points in a grid which have an
given value. 
They are very usefull to get an understanding how far a molecule's potential reaches
into 3D space.
As an example we will create two surfaces, one in red for -0.01 and one
in blue for 0.01.
