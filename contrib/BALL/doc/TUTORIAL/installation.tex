\section{System Requirements}
\label{requirements}

\subsection{Compiler}
\index{compiler}
BALL requires a (more or less) ANSI compliant \CPP compiler. It has been 
successfully built and tested using the {\tt autobuild} script (see Section 
\ref{section:building-ball}) on the following platforms:
\begin{itemize}	
  \item Linux/x86 2.x (32bit Intel and AMD) with a wealth of distributions:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Debian 3.1 (sarge) using g{\tt ++} 3.3.5
      \item Debian unstable (sid) using g{\tt ++} 4.1.3
      \item Fedora Core 6 using g{\tt ++} 4.1.2
      \item Fedora 7 using g{\tt ++} 4.1.2
      \item Gentoo Linux using g{\tt ++} 4.2.0
      \item Redhat 9 (shrike) using g{\tt ++} 3.2.2

      \item Ubuntu 7.04 using g{\tt ++} 4.1.2
    \end{itemize}
  \item Linux/x86 2.x (64bit) on the following distributions:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Scientific Linux 4.2 using g{\tt ++} 3.4.4, 4.0.3, and 4.1.1
    \end{itemize}
  \item MacOS X/Intel (Darwin 8.5.6) using g{\tt ++} 4.0.1
  \item MacOS X/PPC (Darwin 8.10) using g{\tt ++} 4.0.1
\end{itemize}

\noindent 
Using the configure/make mechanisms, there are reports on successful
installations on the following platforms:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Solaris/SPARC 8 using g{\tt ++} 3.2.1
  \item IRIX 6.5 using CC 7.3.1.1m (32 and 64 bit)
  \item FreeBSD/x86 using g{\tt ++} 3.4.4
  \item Linux/x86 2.x (32bit) using the Intel \CPP Compiler icc/icpc 9.1
\end{itemize}


\subsection{BALL on the Windows Platform}

For instructions on how to install BALL on the Windows platform, please
have a look at {\tt BALL/Windows/README.txt}. We recommend using the 
Windows installer provided on the BALL project page. The sections below will 
describe how to build BALL on Unix, Linux and MacOS...

\subsection{External Software and Libraries}

BALL needs {\tt flex} and {\tt bison} for automatically generating parsers
for various purposes. These utilities are standard software and should be
installed on every contemporary UN*X machine. The newest versions are
downloadable from \URL{http://www.gnu.org/software/}.

The usage of GNU {\tt make} is recommended, although BALL will also build with
other versions of {\tt make}. It is available from \URL{ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/}
and easy to install.

The compilation of the visualization component VIEW also requires the Qt 
library (at least version 4.2), which is available from
\URL{http://trolltech.com/products/qt}.

If Qt was not installed in one of the standard library paths or the
Qt header files were not installed in one of the compiler's default
include directories, use \mbox{"\option{--with-qt-libs}{\tt{}=DIR}"} and
\mbox{"\option{--with-qt-incl}{\tt{}=DIR}"} as options to configure (see
Section \ref{section:building-ball}) to specify the paths Qt was installed
to.\index{Qt} {\tt configure} will also honor the {\tt QTDIR} environment variable.

Qt also requires OpenGL~\cite{OpenGL}. On platforms that do not provide OpenGL,
Mesa~\cite{Mesa} can be used. Mesa is a 3-D graphics library with an API which
is very similar to that of OpenGL. It can be obtained from 
\URL{http://www.mesa3d.org}.
\index{Mesa}

BALL uses GLEW, the OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library for access to the OpenGL
extensions. If the GLEW library is not installed, BALLView will still work, but
the advanced OpenGL features like volume rendering, vertex buffers and so on
will not work. GLEW is freely available from \URL{http://glew.sourceforge.net}.
\index{GLEW}

If your machine has a graphics accelerator from Intel, ATI-AMD or NVidia, you
can use the vendor-provided OpenGL drivers. The respective download locations
are \URL{http://www.intel.com/support/graphics} (Intel),
\URL{http://ati.amd.com/support/driver.html} (ATI-AMD), and
\URL{http://www.nvidia.com/content/drivers} (NVidia).

To use the Python extensions of BALL (Python is an object oriented scripting
language), \index{Python} you will also need Python (version 2.3 or above) 
installed (\URL{http://www.python.org}) and a recent version of SIP (version 
4.5.2 or above, available at \URL{http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/sip/}).
SIP~\cite{SIP} \index{SIP} is a tool for generating Python bindings for \CPP 
class libraries.

Additionally you might need the \Index{FFTW} \cite{FFTW} package for fast 
Fourier transformations (version 3.1.2), available from 
\URL{http://www.fftw.org/}.

Please make sure that the required external \CPP libraries (\ie Qt and SIP)
have been compiled with the same compiler (and compiler version!) as the BALL
libraries. Otherwise you will most likely see a plethora of strange error
messages, either while linking applications or at runtime.


\section{Installation}
\label{section:building-ball}

We provide two different ways to build the libraries and applications:

The first one is the \file{autobuild} script. The build process is started by 
simply typing

\begin{lstlisting}{}
  ./autobuild
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent in the directory \directory{BALL/source}.  
This procedure is especially suited for unexperienced users, since it 
automatically downloads a contrib source package from our website. This 
package contains almost all dependencies and prevents any clashes with already 
installed libraries, by compiling and installing them in a subfolder in the 
BALL directory. Afterwards, the BALL library is configured, build and linked 
against the downloaded libraries. We recommend to use the {\tt autobuild} 
script for installations which should run out of the box on most platforms. 
This kind of installation will include all of
BALL and \mbox{BALLView's} features. If this is not desired or you want to 
configure the library with different settings, please proceed like stated below:

As an alternative BALL can be configured with a classical configure/make
run. If all requirements stated in Section \ref{requirements} are met, BALL is
built by issuing the following commands in the directory 
\directory{BALL/source}:

\begin{lstlisting}{}
  ./configure
  make
  make install
\end{lstlisting}

The following sections give further details on the configuration of the 
library, on the library files created, how to test the library, and how to 
build BALL applications.

\subsection{Configuring BALL}
\index{configure!usage}

"{\tt configure}" tries to gather as much information on your system as 
possible and then creates the necessary configuration files (\file{config.h},
\file{config.mak}, \file{common.mak}, and \file{Makefile}).
The configuration of BALL may be adapted to your needs and to your system
configuration from the command line by adding one or more of the options from
Table \ref{table:options}.
An overview of these options can also be obtained by executing "{\tt configure
--help}"

                                           (commas are converted to blanks)
                                           \\\vspace{3mm}

  \option{--with-arflags}{\tt{}=FLAGS}&    add FLAGS to the flags for the
                                           creation of the static libraries
                                           \\\vspace{3mm}

  \option{--with-qt}{\tt{}=QTDIR}&         Qt installation is in QTDIR. This
                                           option is equivalent to setting the
                                           {\tt QTDIR} environment variable.
                                           Using this option should be
                                           preferred over the next two options,
                                           which are only necessary if the Qt
                                           installation has non-standard paths
                                           for libraries and headers.\\

                                           found in {\tt\$QTDIR/bin/moc})
                                           \\\vspace{3mm}

  \option{--with-uic}{\tt{}=UIC}&          The absolute path to the Qt user
                                           interface compiler (uic, typically

                                           ({\tt --with-python} only),
                                           {\tt configure} looks for an

                                           PATH. Typically, from the executable
                                           {\tt configure} can figure out where
                                           the headers and the library are
                                           hidden, so that the following two
                                           options are usually not required.\\

\hline
\caption{Options for {\tt configure}}
\label{table:options}
\end{longtable}

For example, to compile BALL without the visualization component, specify 

\begin{lstlisting}{}
  configure --disable-VIEW
\end{lstlisting}

To compile the visualization classes using the Qt installation in
/opt/misc/qt, specify the path to the Qt directory as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}{}
  configure --with-qt=/opt/misc/qt
\end{lstlisting}

If the headers or libraries are installed in non-standard directories, you can
also specify them separately:

\begin{lstlisting}{}
  configure --with-qt-libs=/opt/lib 
		--with-qt-incl=/opt/qt/include
\end{lstlisting}

If \Index{Mesa} should be used (when compiling under Linux), the correct 
options might look like this:

\begin{lstlisting}{}	
  configure --with-qt-libs=/opt/qt/lib 
		--with-qt-incl=/opt/qt/include
    --with-opengl-libs=/opt/mesa/lib 
		--with-opengl-incl=/opt/mesa/include
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Building the Libraries}

After the successful termination of configure, issuing "make" will build the
shared libraries. Two different libraries will be built:

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{ll}
  	\file{libBALL.so}&     the main BALL library\\
  	\file{libVIEW.so}&     the visualization classes\\
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The latter library is not built if "\option{--disable-VIEW}" is specified or 
configure cannot find X libraries, OpenGL libraries, or Qt libraries (and the 
respective headers).

It is also possible (although not recommended) to build the corresponding 
static libraries \file{libBALL.a} and \file{libVIEW.a} using "{\tt make
staticlibs}". Please note that statically linked binaries are huge.

\subsection{Installing the Libraries}

After compiling the libraries, they are installed in {\tt BALL/lib/\${BINFMT}/}
when calling "{\tt make install}" where {\tt \${BINFMT}} is the binary format
as determined by {\tt configure}.  Currently, the only way to install the
libraries somewhere else is by moving them by hand to the desired destination.
Wherever you install the shared libraries, please make sure to include their
location in the \ttindex{LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH} environment variable.

If you are using \Index{csh}, \Index{tcsh}, or similar shells, use the command

\begin{lstlisting}{}
   setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH DIR
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent to set the library path. If you are using \Index{sh}, \Index{bash},
or related shells, try

\begin{lstlisting}{}   
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH=DIR
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
\end{lstlisting}

If you installed the shared libraries in a directory that the dynamic linker
\ttindex{ld} searches by default, it is not necessary to set {\tt
LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH}.
