	TreeFolder

1. Overview

TreeFolder is a software package that produces RNA 3D structure decoys based a
 pre-trained conditional random field with a given RNA sequence and its secondary 
structure.

Zhiyong Wang and Jinbo Xu, A conditional random fields method for RNA sequence-
structure relationship modeling and conformation sampling. Bioinformatics, (2011) 
27(13): i102-i110

This software has been compiled and tested on a Ubuntu 9.04 Linux server (kernel 
2.6.28-19-server) with Quad-Core AMD Opteron(tm) Processors.

2. Compile and Install

Before installation, please make sure that Perl v5.10.0 is properly installed on 
your computer systems. To install the package, first create a new folder and uncompress
all the files in the package to the folder and compile it by following commands.

> cd src; make treefolder

Sometimes you need re-compile contrafold and ANN library to install this package. 
See src/contrafold/doc/manual.pdf for compiling contrafold and src/ann_1.1.1/ReadMe.txt 
for ANN library.

Then, change the variable $HOME in bin/run_treefolder.pl to the path the package
is installed.

3. Run TreeFolder

>./bin/run_treefolder.pl -fasta test/157d.seq -jobid 157d-1

TreeFolder will generate a single result file 157d-1.decoy.pdb in current directory.

4. File Formats

The input file can be in a FASTA-formatted file or a plain text file. The nucleotides 
of A,C,G,U are allowed in the input file. See test/157d.seq for an example.
